  AI Design Sprint

  </h2>
  
  <p>
    An AI Design Sprint is a time-constrained process executed by an interdisciplinary team. The process focuses on proving the practical applicability of artificial intelligence models within an organisation. The result is a prototype that automates parts of a business process, including a reflection on how a business will be able to work with AI in the future.
